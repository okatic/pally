                <p>
                    This document is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as an offer to sell shares or securities using the Pally platform or any other affiliated company.

                    Pally tokens do not grant the right of control.
                    Owning Pally tokens does not give their holder the right of ownership or the right to property in Pally. While the community’s opinion and feedback can be taken into account, Pally tokens do not give their holders any right to participate in decision making concerning the development of the Pally ecosystem. Pally tokens can be used to purchase experiences from the community marketplace, and reward people who provide helpful community suggestions in the social app.

                    No guarantee of income or profit
                    All the examples of income and profits calculation used in any documentation are given for demonstrative purposes only or for showing industry averages and do not constitute a guarantee that these results will be obtained according to the plan.

                    Regulatory uncertainty
                    Blockchain-related technologies are subject to supervision and control by different regulatory bodies around the world. Pally tokens may fall under one or more inquiries or actions on their part, including but not limited to imposing restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens such as Pally tokens, which may slow or limit the functionality of the system or the process of purchasing Pally tokens in the future.

                    Pally tokens are not an investment
                    Pally tokens are not an official or legally binding investment of any kind. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the objectives set forth in this document may be amended. Despite the fact that we intend to reach all the goals described in this document, all persons and parties involved in the purchase of Pally tokens do so at their own risk.

                    Quantum computers
                    Technical innovations, such as the development of quantum computers, may pose a danger to cryptocurrencies, including Pally tokens.

                    Insufficient use
                    Despite the fact that Pally tokens should not be considered as an investment, they can gain in value in the course of time. They may also fall in value if they are not actively used in the Pally system.

                    Risk of loss of funds
                    Funds collected during the ICO procedure are not insured. In the event of loss or loss of value, there is no private or public insurance representative whom the buyer could address.

                    Risk of Failure
                    It is possible that for various reasons, including but not limited to the failure of business arrangements or marketing strategies, that the Pally ecosystem and all subsequent business activities related to the funds collected during the ICO procedure may be unsuccessful.

                    The risk of using new technologies
                    Crypto tokens, such as Pally, are a fairly new and relatively untested technology. In addition to the risks mentioned in any documentation, there are additional risks that the Pally team cannot predict. These risks may emerge in other forms rather than those indicated here.

                    Integration
                    This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. All previous agreements, discussions, presentations, warranties, and conditions are combined in this document. There are no warranties, conditions or agreements, express or implied, between the parties, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document duly executed by the parties.

                    Disclaimer of Warranties
                    You agree that your use or inability to use Pally tokens is solely at your own risk and you remove all responsibility from Pally, via Penpal Group. Since the date of issue, Pally tokens will be sent to you without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties of commercial value for a particular purpose without violating anyone’s intellectual property rights. As some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, the above exclusion of implied warranties may not apply to you.
